They ask you ‘Are you a robot?’. We treat you and your customers like humans. To solve Lemin Captcha, you simply need to be human. Lemin believe in less barriers and more play. Security should happen automatically, without you ever being left wondering ‘What do I need to do next?’

= Does Lemin Captcha use cookies? =

Yes. We use cookies so that your users are only asked to solve puzzle challenges one time. They can then skip them for up to 30 days. Our verification process works by matching users’ cookie-ids on their web browsers and hashed user-ids from the Lemin server. When users login to your website, our JS tags will automatically generate anonymized user IDs. We never store any of your raw data.
